# WFRP Combat Aid

The goal of this project is to improve the speed of combat in WFRP campaigns.

Do you like playing WFRP but get tired of digging through tables during combat? This is the tool for you! You no longer need to worry about looking up the hit location, the critical value, or the critical hit's effect. This handy application takes just two numbers--your critical damage and your roll to hit--and automatically calculates your hit location and critical effects. Set the rulebooks aside and join the fray!
